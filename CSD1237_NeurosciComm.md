## Description
This course describes the fundamentals of human brain organization and function as relevant to human communication. Cutting-edge and time-tested neuroscientific methods are emphasized, empowering students to critically evaluate current research literature on hearing, speech, language, and cognition.  Our understanding of the functional organization of the brain will both provide insight into and gain insights from neurological conditions that affect communication at different stages of life.


## Learning Resources, Technology, & Texts

### Canvas
Materials, assignments, and grades for the course will be
posted on [Canvas](https://canvas.pitt.edu/).
Canvas will serve as the starting point for all course material.
Materials may also be hosted elsewhere and links provided on Canvas.


### Textbooks
Because human neuroscience is a fast-paced field, there are **no** required textbooks. Readings from primary literature, class notes/slides, and other handouts/resources will be posted on Canvas. 

The following references are listed as general resources that provide coverage of many of topics discussed in this course. While the first two (Andreatta, 2024; Mason, 2017) take a medical neurobiology perspective and are written as textbooks, the third (Poeppel, Mangun, and Gazzinage, 2020) is an extensive edited volume on cognititve neuroscience and contains chapters contributed by experts on each topic.

1. Andreatta, R.D. (2024). Neuroscience Fundamentals for Communication Sciences and Disorders, Second Edition. Plural Publishing. ISBN: 9781635503593.
2. Mason, P. (2017). Medical Neurobiology. 2nd Edition. Oxford University Press. ISBN: 9780190237523.
3. Poeppel, D., Mangun, G.R., and Gazzaniga, M.S. (2020).The Cognitive Neurosciences, Sixth Edition. The MIT Press. ISBN: 9780262043250

In case you choose to purchase the Andreatta (2024) textbook, please note that there is a 15% student discount if purchasing directly from [Plural's website](https://www.pluralpublishing.com/) using the promo code ST15.


### Discussion Forum
We will use a group discussion board within  Canvas
for Q&A and discussion. Rather than emails, using the discussion board is the
preferred method for asking questions outside class.

Using the discussion board allows for getting help
quickly and efficiently both from classmates, and the instructors. You are
encouraged to ask *and answer* questions about logistics, content,
assignments, or projects.
However, please do *not* share explicit solutions to assignments, projects etc.
You are also encouraged to share any ideas, articles, videos, or other resources related to 
neuroscience of communication that you think would be interesting and/or beneficial to others.


## Assignments and projects
Assignments will typically be made available a week before they are due (sometimes 2 weeks).
Assignments will typically involve integrating concepts/content discussed in class with readings of primary literature, discussing the application of the ideas to specific cases, designing neuroscience experiments, participating in or observing simple experiments, querying webpages of research labs/standardized databases, and watching/summarizing video presentations by other professionals/scientists. All assignments are due by the time and date posted on Canvas. You are encouraged to discuss course topics with your colleagues, but discussions involving assignments should be done *in broad/general terms*. Please do not share specific solutions to assignments. Projects are essentially extended assignments with the added feature that they are somewhat individualized (student selected).


There is a quota of **three total late days** you can use
throughout the semester to manage unanticipated pressing events that may
prevent you from submitting quizzes on time. Save and use them
judiciously. You can use all three days for one assignment/project or spread
them over (up to) three assignments/projects.
Note however that part-day delays (e.g., late by 2 hours) will count as
1 whole day of quota being used up.
No submissions will be accepted, even if you have unused late days,
after April 27, 2024 (Friday of final exam week).
For any additional delays beyond the 3-day rule,
there is a 20% penalty per day applied to the corresponding assignments.
Exceptions will only be made in unavoidable circumstances (e.g., extended
health<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> issue) about which you discuss with the instructor as soon as
the situation permits, and make alternative arrangements.

## Attendance Policy
Face-to-face meeting in class is the primary modality of instruction and in-person attendance is
required and generally expected for all classes throughout the semester. However,
absence or remote attendance due to unavoidable reasons will be accommodated.
To facilitate this, lectures/seminars will also be available remotely via synchronous Zoom sessions,
and asynchronously via recorded video.
If you need to miss a class or attend remotely, please inform the instructor
in a timely manner (if the situation permits). In such cases,
it is your responsibility to catch up with
the material that you miss using the asynchronously available video
recordings. If extended absence and schedule adjustments are
necessitated by unavoidable circumstances, please contact the instructor
for working out alternative arrangements as soon as the situation permits. Note
that office hours and the discussion forum are available to assist you
as well.

## Academic Integrity
Students in this course will be expected to comply with the [University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html).

## Health and Safety Statement
With COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses still circulating, students and instructors may choose to wear masks in class regardless of specific campus-wide masking requirements.


## Gender Inclusive Language Statement
Language is gender-inclusive and non-sexist when we use words that affirm and respect how people describe, express, and experience their gender.  Gender-inclusive/non-sexist language acknowledges people of all genders (for example, first year student versus freshman, chair versus chairman, humankind versus mankind, everyone versus ladies and gentlemen, etc.).  It also affirms non-binary gender identifications, and recognizes both gender identity and expression.  Identities including trans, intersex, and genderqueer reflect personal descriptions, expressions, and experiences.  Just as sexist language excludes women’s experiences, gendered language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identifies may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.  Students, faculty, and staff have the right to control their own identity and to be referred to by the name and pronouns with which they identify.  People also have the right to maintain their privacy regarding information they do not wish to share about their identities, including gender identity and pronouns.

Finally, we, as instructors, can be flawed and accidentally overlook gendered-language. If you notice that we do, please e-mail us to notify and allow us to correct our future presentations.
