## Description
This course describes the fundamentals of human brain organization and function as relevant to human communication. Cutting-edge and time-tested neuroscientific methods are emphasized, empowering students to critically evaluate current research literature on hearing, language, speech, and swallowing.  Our understanding of the functional organization of the brain will both provide insight into and gain insights from neurological conditions that affect communication at different stages of life.


## Learning Resources, Technology, & Texts

### Canvas
Materials, assignments, and grades for the course will be
posted on [Canvas](https://canvas.pitt.edu/).
Canvas will serve as the starting point for all course material.
Materials may also be hosted elsewhere and links provided on Canvas.


### Textbooks
Because human neuroscience is a fast-paced field, there are **no** required textbooks. Readings from primary literature, class notes/slides, and other handouts/resources will be posted on Canvas. The following two references provide overviews of many of topics discussed in this course. While the former (Andreatta, 2024) takes a medical neurobiology perspective and is written as a textbook, the latter (Poeppel, Mangun, and Gazzinage, 2020) is a compiled comprehensive reference from a cognititve neuroscience perspective with chapters contributed by experts on each topic.

1. Andreatta, R.D. (2024). Neuroscience Fundamentals for Communication Sciences and Disorders, Second Edition. Plural Publishing. ISBN: 9781635503593.
2. Poeppel, D., Mangun, G.R., and Gazzaniga, M.S. (2020).The Cognitive Neurosciences, Sixth Edition. The MIT Press. ISBN: 9780262043250


### Discussion Forum
We will use a group discussion board within  Canvas
for Q&A and discussion. Rather than emails, using the discussion board is the
preferred method for asking questions outside class.

Using the discussion board allows for getting help
quickly and efficiently both from classmates, and the instructor. You are
encouraged to ask *and answer* questions about logistics, content,
assignments, case/research presentations, or exams.
However, please do *not* share explicit solutions to assignments, exams etc.
You are also encouraged to share any ideas, articles, videos, or other resources related to 
hearing preservation and restoration that you think would be interesting and/or beneficial to others.


## Assignments and projects
Assignments will typically be made available a week before they are due (sometimes 2 weeks).
Assignments will typically involve integrating concepts/content discussed in class with readings of primary literature, discussing the application of the ideas to specific cases, designing neuroscience experiments, participating in or observing simple experiments, querying webpages of research labs/standardized databases, and watching/summarizing video presentations by other professionals/scientists. All assignments are due by the time and date posted on Canvas. You are encouraged to discuss course topics with your colleagues, but discussions involving assignments should be done *in broad/general terms*. Please do not share specific solutions to assignments. Projects are essentially extended assignments with the added feature that they are individualized (student selected).


There is a quota of **three total late** days you can use
throughout the semester to manage unanticipated pressing events that may
prevent you from submitting assignments on time. Save and use them
judiciously. You can use all three days for one assignment or spread
them over (up to) three assignments. You can also use them for projects.
Note however that part-day delays (e.g., late by 6 hours) will count as
1 whole day of quota being used up.
No submissions will be accepted, even if you have unused late days,
after April 28, 2023 (Friday of final exam week). Exceptions will be made
to the 3-day rule only in unavoidable circumstances (e.g., extended
health<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> issue) about which you discuss with the instructor as soon as
the situation permits, and make alternate arrangements.

## Health and Safety Statement
During this pandemic, it is extremely important that you abide by the [public health regulations](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx), the University of Pittsburgh’s [health standards and guidelines](https://www.policy.pitt.edu/university-policies-and-procedures/covid-19-standards-and-guidelines), and [Pitt’s Health Rules](https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/healthy-community/pitts-health-rules). These rules have been developed to protect the health and safety of all of us.  

The University’s requirements for face coverings will at a minimum be consistent with [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) and masks are required indoors (campus buildings and shuttles) on campuses in which COVID-19 Community Levels are High. This means that when COVID-19 Community Levels are High, you must wear a face covering that properly covers your nose and mouth when you are in the classroom. If you do not comply, you will be asked to leave class. It is your responsibility to have the required face covering when entering a university building or classroom. Masks are encouraged, but optional indoors for campuses in which county levels are Medium or Low. Be aware of your [Community Level](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) as it changes each Thursday. [Read answers to frequently asked questions regarding face coverings](https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/frequently-asked-questions-about-face-coverings). For the most up-to-date information and guidance, please visit [coronavirus.pitt.edu](https://coronavirus.pitt.edu) and check your Pitt email for updates before each class.

If you are required to isolate or quarantine, become sick, or are unable to come to class,
please inform me in a timely manner (if the situation permits).
In such cases, it is your responsibility to catch up with
the material that you miss using the asynchronously available video
recordings. If extended absence and schedule adjustments are
necessitated by unavoidable circumstances, please contact me
for working out alternate arrangements as soon as the situation permits.

## Gender Inclusive Language Statement
Language is gender-inclusive and non-sexist when we use words that affirm and respect how people describe, express, and experience their gender.  Gender-inclusive/non-sexist language acknowledges people of all genders (for example, first year student versus freshman, chair versus chairman, humankind versus mankind, everyone versus ladies and gentlemen, etc.).  It also affirms non-binary gender identifications, and recognizes both gender identity and expression.  Identities including trans, intersex, and genderqueer reflect personal descriptions, expressions, and experiences.  Just as sexist language excludes women’s experiences, gendered language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identifies may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.  Students, faculty, and staff have the right to control their own identity and to be referred to by the name and pronouns with which they identify.  People also have the right to maintain their privacy regarding information they do not wish to share about their identities, including gender identity and pronouns.
