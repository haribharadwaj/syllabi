## Description
Trauma to the ear from sound and ototoxic agents is often preventable. This course will focus on 1) the epidemiology of such trauma, and understanding the mechanisms that damage the inner ear, 2) selection and implementation of hearing protection methods including noise control, physical hearing protection, and pharmacological otoprotective agents, 3) understanding and implementing national guidelines for hearing protection programs and overseeing ototoxicity monitoring programs in medical and clinical-trial contexts, 4) exploring the emerging area of hearing restoration post trauma.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Describe the auditory and non-auditory effects of acoustic overexposure.
2. Identify the key components of hearing-loss prevention programs, and design protocols and materials for implementing national guidelines for hearing protection.
3. Perform environmental acoustic measurements, personal exposure assessments, selection of hearing protection devices, and estimation of real-world acoustic attentuation provided by such devices for an individual user.
4. Describe basic concepts in pharmacology, identify common drugs used in otolaryngological practice, and important classes of drugs and other substances with known ototoxicity.
5. Develop materials for implementing ototoxicity monitoring in medical contexts and clinical trials.
6. Apply knowledge about the molecular mechanisms leading to noise- and drug-induced hearing damage (and their overlap) to identify candidate targets and agents for otoprotection and restoration.

### Discussion Forum
We will use a group discussion board within  Canvas
for Q&A and discussion. Rather than emails, using the discussion board is the
preferred method for asking questions outside class.

Using the discussion board allows for getting help
quickly and efficiently both from classmates, and the instructor. You are
encouraged to ask *and answer* questions about logistics, content,
assignments, case/research presentations, or exams.
However, please do *not* share explicit solutions to assignments, exams etc.
You are also encouraged to share any ideas, articles, videos, or other resources related to 
hearing preservation and restoration that you think would be interesting and/or beneficial to others.


## Assignments (Quizzes and short reports)
Quizzes (six) will typically be made available a week before they are due.
Quizzes will involve integrating concepts/content discussed in class with readings of primary literature, applying ideas to specific cases, querying standardized databases (e.g., [FDA MedWatch](https://www.fda.gov/medwatch), [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov)), and watching video presentations by other professionals/scientists. There are two "lab" activities that will also involve hands-on measurements (environmental noise and personal exposure assessments, and HPD fit-testing). 
A short report will be due following each lab (instructions will be provided). Submitted work will consist of electronic responses or PDF file uploads via Canvas. All assignments due by the time and date posted on Canvas. You are encouraged to discuss course topics with your colleagues, but discussions involving assignments should be done *in broad/general terms*. Please do not share specific solutions.

There is a quota of **five total late days** you can use
throughout the semester to manage unanticipated pressing events that may
prevent you from submitting assignments on time. Save and use them
judiciously. You can use all five days for one assignment or spread
them over (up to) five assignments.
Note however that part-day delays (e.g., late by 2 hours) will count as
1 whole day of quota being used up.
No submissions will be accepted, even if you have unused late days,
after Dec 15, 2023 (Friday of final exam week). Exceptions
to the 5-day rule will only be made in unavoidable circumstances (e.g., extended
health<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> issue) about which you discuss with me as soon as
the situation permits, and make alternative arrangements.

## Health and Safety Statement
During this pandemic, it is extremely important that you abide by the [public health regulations](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx), the University of Pittsburghâ€™s [health standards and guidelines](https://www.policy.pitt.edu/university-policies-and-procedures/covid-19-standards-and-guidelines), and [Pittâ€™s Health Rules](https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/healthy-community/pitts-health-rules). These rules have been developed to protect the health and safety of all of us.  

The Universityâ€™s requirements for face coverings will at a minimum be consistent with [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) and masks are required indoors (campus buildings and shuttles) on campuses in which COVID-19 Community Levels are High. This means that when COVID-19 Community Levels are High, you must wear a face covering that properly covers your nose and mouth when you are in the classroom. If you do not comply, you will be asked to leave class. It is your responsibility to have the required face covering when entering a university building or classroom. Masks are encouraged, but optional indoors for campuses in which county levels are Medium or Low. Be aware of your [Community Level](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) as it changes each Thursday. [Read answers to frequently asked questions regarding face coverings](https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/frequently-asked-questions-about-face-coverings). For the most up-to-date information and guidance, please visit [coronavirus.pitt.edu](https://coronavirus.pitt.edu) and check your Pitt email for updates before each class.

If you are required to isolate or quarantine, become sick, or are unable to come to class,
please inform me in a timely manner (if the situation permits).
In such cases, it is your responsibility to catch up with
the material that you miss using the asynchronously available video
recordings. If extended absence and schedule adjustments are
necessitated by unavoidable circumstances, please contact me
for working out alternative arrangements as soon as the situation permits.

## Gender Inclusive Language Statement
Language is gender-inclusive and non-sexist when we use words that affirm and respect how people describe, express, and experience their gender.  Gender-inclusive/non-sexist language acknowledges people of all genders (for example, first year student versus freshman, chair versus chairman, humankind versus mankind, everyone versus ladies and gentlemen, etc.).  It also affirms non-binary gender identifications, and recognizes both gender identity and expression.  Identities including trans, intersex, and genderqueer reflect personal descriptions, expressions, and experiences.  Just as sexist language excludes womenâ€™s experiences, gendered language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identifies may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.  Students, faculty, and staff have the right to control their own identity and to be referred to by the name and pronouns with which they identify.  People also have the right to maintain their privacy regarding information they do not wish to share about their identities, including gender identity and pronouns.
