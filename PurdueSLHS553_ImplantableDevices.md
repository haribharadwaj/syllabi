### Discussion Forum -- Slack
We will use a group discussion forum
for Q&A and discussion.
Specifically, we will use Slack.
Details to join the Slack workspace for this course will be
provided on Brightspace. Rather than emails, Slack is the
preferred method for asking questions outside class.

Using Slack allows for getting help
quickly and efficiently from classmates, and instructors. You are
encouraged to ask *and answer* questions about logistics, content,
assignments, case/research presentations, or exams.
However, please do *not* share explicit solutions to assignments, exams etc.
You are also encouraged to share any ideas, articles, or videos related to 
implantable devices that you think would be interesting and/or beneficial others.


## Research Presentation
Each student will critically summarize the recent research on a self-selected implantable devices question.  The topic selection will be done as part of A4 Part (ii). Towards the end of the semester, each student will give an oral presentation(about 10--12 min) on the selected topic in a format similar to a short conference presentation. A list of questions studied in previous years will be provided as reference.

##  Clinical Case Presentation
Each student will analyze and orally summarize the details of an implantable-device clinical case. Students are welcome to bring their own cases (check with instructor if the case is suitable), or present a case that is assigned to them by the instructor. The oral presentation (about 10--12 min) should stimulate discussion of the issues pertinent to the case based on knowledge acquired during this course *and* from previous classes. Any broader takeaways that the case suggests should also be discussed.

## Guest Lectures
Because the field of implantable devices is interdisciplinary, the course will include presentations by guest speakers. Following the guest lectures, students should anticipate parts of an assignment to involve (a) summarizing aspects of the material presented by the guest speaker in plain language (e.g., imagining that you are counseling a patient about a certain technological feature), (b) answering simple questions about the material presented, (c) critically examining any claims made by the presenter (especially when they are representing a device manufacturer), etc.

## Assignments 
Assignments will typically be made available a week before they are due (sometimes 2 weeks).
Submitted work will consist of electronic files (PDF) uploaded through Brightspace.
All assignments are due by the time and date posted on Brightspace. 

There is a quota of **three total late** days you can use
throughout the semester to manage unanticipated pressing events that may
prevent you from submitting assignments on time. Save and use them
judiciously. You can use all three days for one assignment or spread
them over (up to) three assignments. You can also use them for take-home exams.
Note however that part-day delays (e.g., late by 2 hours) will count as
1 whole day of quota being used up.
No submissions will be accepted, even if you have unused late days,
after May 06, 2022 (Friday of final exam week). Exceptions will be made
to the 3-day rule only in unavoidable circumstances (e.g., extended
health<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> issue) about which you discuss with the instructor as soon as
the situation permits, and make alternate arrangements.

Purdue Pledge](https://protect.purdue.edu/pledge/), is campus policy and
as such all members of the Purdue community must comply with the
required health and safety guidelines. 

Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person
in a campus room (e.g., classroom) is threatening the safety of others
by not complying may leave the room without consequence.
The student is encouraged to report the behavior to and
discuss next steps with their instructor. Students also have the option
of reporting the behavior to the [Office of the Student Rights and
Responsibilities](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/). See also Purdue
University [Bill of Student
Rights](https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=2852#purdue-university-bill-of-student-rights)
and the Violent Behavior Policy under University Resources in Brightspace. 


## Emergency Preparedness
In the event of a major campus emergency, course
requirements, deadlines and grading percentages are subject to changes
that may be necessitated by a revised semester calendar or other
circumstances beyond the instructor's control. Relevant changes to this
course will be announced on Brightspace or can be obtained by
contacting the instructor via email or Slack. You are expected to read your
\@purdue.edu email on a frequent basis and consult Brightspace announcements.

## Academic integrity
See
https://www.purdue.edu/odos/academic-integrity/ -- *"Purdue University
values intellectual integrity and the highest standards of academic
conduct. To be prepared to meet societal needs as leaders and role
models, students must be educated in an ethical learning environment
that promotes a high standard of honor in scholastic work. Academic
dishonesty undermines institutional integrity and threatens the academic
fabric of Purdue University. Dishonesty is not an acceptable avenue to
success. It diminishes the quality of a Purdue education, which is
valued because of Purdue's high academic standards. Fostering an
appreciation for academic standards and values is a shared
responsibility among students, faculty, and staff. The information [on
this website](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/academic-integrity/) is
directed to students to define academic dishonesty and how to avoid
it."*.

Furthermore, the Purdue Honor Pledge Task Force, a student
organization responsible for stewarding the mission of the Honor Pledge
and encouraging a culture of academic integrity has fashioned the
following pledge: *"As a Boilermaker pursuing academic excellence, I
pledge to be honest and true in all that I do. Accountable together --
We are Purdue."*


## Nondiscrimination Statement
Purdue University is committed to maintaining a community
which recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every
person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual
respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive to
reach his or her own potential. In pursuit of its goal of academic
excellence, the University seeks to develop and nurture diversity. The
University believes that diversity among its many members strengthens
the institution, stimulates creativity, promotes the exchange of ideas,
and enriches campus life. Purdue's nondiscrimination policy [can be
