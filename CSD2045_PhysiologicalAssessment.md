## Description
Acoustic and electrophysiological assays of the auditory system offer an objective, non-invasive window into the integrity and function of the ascending auditory pathway. This course will focus on the measurement, mechanisms of generation, interpretation, and clinical application of auditory evoked responses. Features of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) across the continuum of normal hearing and diverse forms of hearing loss, and applications across the lifespan are emphasized. 

## Learning Outcomes
1. Describe normal aspects of auditory function relevant to the generation and interpretation of common physiological measures used in audiology.
2. Define terminology associated with, and describe the selection and measurement of different flavors of otoacoustic emissions and electrophysiological responses.
3. Identify and label features of OAEs and ABRs in normal hearing and make predictions for how they may be altered by different forms of hearing loss.
4. Interpret OAE and ABR data from test examples for hearing screening and threshold estimation.
5. Interpret OAE and ABR data from test examples for differential audiological diagnoses.

### Required software
For several quizzes, we will utilize [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) to manipulate, analyze, and interpret case/test examples of otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response data. Google Colaboratory is a cloud-based platform equipped with pre-installed software libraries tailored for these analyses. Basic access to Colaboratory is complimentary with a Google account. You may use an existing Google account or create a new one at no cost, specifically for this course. Detailed instructions on how to access and utilize Colaboratory will be provided in class and in conjunction with relevant quizzes.


### Discussion Forum
We will use the group discussion board within Canvas
for Q&A and discussion. Rather than emails, using the discussion board is the
preferred method for asking questions outside class.
Using the discussion board allows for getting help
quickly and efficiently both from classmates, and the instructor. You are
encouraged to ask *and answer* questions about logistics, content,
quizzes, and case presentations.
However, please do *not* share explicit solutions to quizzes, etc.
You are also encouraged to share any ideas, articles, videos, or other resources related to 
the course (or audiology more broadly) that you think would be interesting and/or beneficial to others.


## Quizzes
Quizzes (six) will typically be made available a week before they are due.
Quizzes will probe your understanding of the concepts/content discussed in this course and integration of the ideas with ideas gained from clinical experience, readings of primary literature, and with lab exercises (done as part of the Clinical Procedures Lab course with Dr. Alscher). Quizzes will also involve hands-on exercises working through simulated and/or real case examples and applying knowledge from the course to analyze and interpret physiological measurement results. Quizzes may also involve watching video presentations by other professionals/scientists. Submitted work will consist of electronic responses or PDF file uploads via Canvas. All quizzes due by the time and date posted on Canvas. You are encouraged to discuss course topics with your peers and other colleagues, but discussions involving quizzes should be done *in broad/general terms*. Please do not share specific solutions.

There is a quota of **three total late days** you can use
throughout the semester to manage unanticipated pressing events that may
prevent you from submitting quizzes on time. Save and use them
judiciously. You can use all three days for one assignment or spread
them over (up to) three assignments.
Note however that part-day delays (e.g., late by 2 hours) will count as
1 whole day of quota being used up.
No submissions will be accepted, even if you have unused late days,
after April 27, 2024 (Friday of final exam week).
For any additional delays beyond the 3-day rule,
there is a 20% penalty per day applied to the corresponding quizzes.
Exceptions will only be made in unavoidable circumstances (e.g., extended
health<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> issue) about which you discuss with the instructor as soon as
the situation permits, and make alternative arrangements.

## Clinical Case Presentation
Each student will orally summarize and present their analysis of a clinical case involving physiological assessment(s). Students are welcome to bring their own cases (check with instructor if the case is suitable), or present a case that is assigned to them by the instructor. The oral presentation (about 12--15 mins) should stimulate discussion of the issues pertinent to the case based on knowledge acquired during this course *and* from previous classes/clinical experience. Any broader takeaways that the case suggests should also be discussed.

## Tentative schedule

Each class will be broken into three sessions of about 50 mins each with two 10-minute breaks in between.

If you score below the criterion level in any of the individual assignments, you will be given the opportunity to remediate by resubmitting the assignments on Canvas. The deadlines for resubmission will be worked out by the instructor in discussion with individual students on a case-by-case basis. If your overall grade drops below a C, you may be required to retake the course.


## Attendance Policy
Face-to-face meeting in class is the primary modality of instruction and in-person attendance is
generally expected for all classes throughout the semester. However,
absence or remote attendance due to unavoidable reasons will be accommodated.
To facilitate this, lectures/seminars will also be available remotely via synchronous Zoom sessions,
and asynchronously via recorded video.
If you need to miss a class or attend remotely, please inform the instructor
in a timely manner (if the situation permits). In such cases,
it is your responsibility to catch up with
the material that you miss using the asynchronously available video
recordings. If extended absence and schedule adjustments are
necessitated by unavoidable circumstances, please contact the instructor
for working out alternative arrangements as soon as the situation permits. Note
that office hours and the discussion forum are available to assist you
as well.

## Academic Integrity
Students in this course will be expected to comply with the [University of Pittsburghâ€™s Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html). Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity. This may include, but is not limited to, the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of violating University Policy. Furthermore, no student may bring any unauthorized materials to an exam, including dictionaries and programmable calculators.

To learn more about Academic Integrity, visit the [Academic Integrity Guide](http://pitt.libguides.com/academicintegrity/) for an overview of the topic. For hands-on practice, complete the [Understanding and Avoiding Plagiarism tutorial](http://pitt.libguides.com/academicintegrity/plagiarism).

### Use of Generative AI Tools in Academic Work [GPT-4 provided the outline for this section]
Students are allowed to use generative AI tools, such as GPT-based language models, as supplementary resources for this course. However, the use of these tools must adhere to the following guidelines to maintain academic integrity and scholarly values:

1. **Attribution**: Any direct outputs from a generative AI tool that are included in academic work must be clearly cited.

2. **Original Thought**: Generative AI should be used to augment rather than replace original thinking and scholarship. Your work should primarily reflect your own understanding and synthesis of the subject matter. Examples of acceptable uses of AI tools include idea generation, outlining, proofreading, and grammar checks. Examples of unacceptable use include whole-section generation, substituting AI-generated analyses for your own, and automated research. While there is no fixed ratio for AI-generated vs. student-generated content, a good rule of thumb is that the bulk (for instance >80-90%) of your written output should be your own work, both in content and in analysis, even when properly cited.

3. **Critical Evaluation**: Exercise critical judgment when using AI-generated content. Not all information produced by an AI tool will be accurate or valid in an academic context.

## Health and Safety Statement
During this pandemic, it is extremely important that you abide by the [public health regulations](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx), the University of Pittsburghâ€™s [health standards and guidelines](https://www.policy.pitt.edu/university-policies-and-procedures/covid-19-standards-and-guidelines), and [Pittâ€™s Health Rules](https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/healthy-community/pitts-health-rules). These rules have been developed to protect the health and safety of all of us.  

The Universityâ€™s requirements for face coverings will at a minimum be consistent with [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) and masks are required indoors (campus buildings and shuttles) on campuses in which COVID-19 Community Levels are High. This means that when COVID-19 Community Levels are High, you must wear a face covering that properly covers your nose and mouth when you are in the classroom. If you do not comply, you will be asked to leave class. It is your responsibility to have the required face covering when entering a university building or classroom. Masks are encouraged, but optional indoors for campuses in which county levels are Medium or Low. Be aware of your [Community Level](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) as it changes each Thursday. [Read answers to frequently asked questions regarding face coverings](https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/frequently-asked-questions-about-face-coverings). For the most up-to-date information and guidance, please visit [coronavirus.pitt.edu](https://coronavirus.pitt.edu) and check your Pitt email for updates before each class.

If you are required to isolate or quarantine, become sick, or are unable to come to class,
please inform me in a timely manner (if the situation permits).
In such cases, it is your responsibility to catch up with
the material that you miss using the asynchronously available video
recordings. If extended absence and schedule adjustments are
necessitated by unavoidable circumstances, please contact me
for working out alternative arrangements as soon as the situation permits.

## Gender Inclusive Language Statement
Language is gender-inclusive and non-sexist when we use words that affirm and respect how people describe, express, and experience their gender.  Gender-inclusive/non-sexist language acknowledges people of all genders (for example, first year student versus freshman, chair versus chairman, humankind versus mankind, everyone versus ladies and gentlemen, etc.).  It also affirms non-binary gender identifications, and recognizes both gender identity and expression.  Identities including trans, intersex, and genderqueer reflect personal descriptions, expressions, and experiences.  Just as sexist language excludes womenâ€™s experiences, gendered language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identifies may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.  Students, faculty, and staff have the right to control their own identity and to be referred to by the name and pronouns with which they identify.  People also have the right to maintain their privacy regarding information they do not wish to share about their identities, including gender identity and pronouns.
