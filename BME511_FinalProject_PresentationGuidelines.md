# BME 511: Biomedical Signal Processing (Fall 2021)
# Final Project - Presentation Guidelines

Because of the relatively large class size, and hybrid attendance, final project presentations will not be live.
Instead, presentations will be done via recorded media (audio -or- video -or- transcripts). The submission deadline is **11:59 pm on December 15, 2021**. A project *showcase website* will be setup where presentations will be made available shortly after the deadline.

## Materials to be uploaded for submission (4 items)

To reduce the time commitment needed to prepare your own presentation and to watch the presentations of your peers, the presentations will be brief (about 6-7 minutes long ideally, but certainly under 10 minutes). Please upload the following materials to Brightspace by 11:59 pm on December 15, 2021:
1. A title (limit: 20 words) and a brief abstract (limit: 250 words) summarizing the project 
2. Slides accompaning the presentation in PDF format
3. A recorded presentation (about 6-7 minutes long ideally, but certainly under 10 minutes). The recording can be a video (uploaded as a ```.mp4``` or ```.mov``` file), audio (uploaded as a ```.mp3``` or ```.wav``` file), or a text transcript of a presentation (uploaded as a ```.pdf``` file). You may use any method/tool to record your presentation. One simple option for recording a video presentation would be to use a Zoom meeting (by yourself or with friends) where you can share your screen with the slides and simultaneously deliver your presentation. Brightspace also has options for recording audio or video in the assignment submission section. If uploading an audio or text transcript, please remember to announce when you advance from one slide to the next. If providing a text transcript, the transcript should also adhere to the duration guidelines when it is read out at a reasonable pace.
4. Provide an answer to the following question (enter in the text box on Brightspace while uploading the materials): *Are you OK with your presentation being available publicly?* [**Yes/No**]. The default is **Yes**, which means that your presentation will be viewable by anyone accessing the showcase website (including your peers) for about 6 months after the submission deaadline. If you pick **No**, your presentation will *not* be available publicly, and will only be viewable by course staff (Instructor/TA). Your answer to this question will not affect your grade.

> **_NOTE:_**
You are encouraged to view the presentations of your peers, even if after the semester has ended. There are no points allocated for viewing them.

## Content of the presentation

Your brief presentation (6-7 minutes ideally, but certainly under 10 minutes) should cover the following:
- An introduction to the scientific question (or) engineering problem being addressed
- A brief outline of what data you worked with and what the project objective(s) is(are).
- A brief description of what signal processing steps were applied. The rationale for the steps and how they relate to the project objectives should also be clear.
- Key results if you were able to meet your project objectives, or any intermediate figures that help understand whatever stumbling blocks you ran into
- Overall conclusions (regardless of whether you were able to meet project objectives) about the scientific question (or) engineering problem based on your results

The abstract should be a concise summary of the above.
